### Software Architect | System Design | High-Performance Computing

With **25 years of experience** in software engineering, I specialize in architecting systems where performance, stability, and user experience are non-negotiable. 

My career has been defined by a "can-do" attitude. Whether optimizing AI workloads on GPUs or writing kernel context switches in assembly, my goal is always **simplicity in complexity**: turning difficult technical challenges into seamless, high-quality products.


### Architecture & Philosophy

I do not write code just to make it work; I design architectures to last. My approach focuses on:

* **User Experience First:** Even deep system-level code ultimately serves a user. Quality and responsiveness are the primary features.
* **Performance:** Unlocking the full potential of hardware through aggressive optimization and low-level understanding.
* **Simplicity:** Reducing cognitive load by abstracting complexity behind clean, robust interfaces.


### Core Competencies

* **Languages:** C++ (Modern/C++20), C, Assembly.
* **Domains:** GPU Computing & AI Optimization, System Programming, Embedded Systems, Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
* **Focus:** Hardware-software co-design, cross-platform portability, and latency-critical applications.


### Professional Background

I have led engineering efforts and architectural decisions for global technology giants, including **Intel**, **ByteDance** and other Tier-1 technology corporations specializing in hardware and telecommunications.*


### Featured Work

**[Sirius RTOS](https://github.com/mmoczala/SiriusRTOS)** - *A robust, preemptive real-time kernel architected for "Power through Safety."*

A preemptive operating system built from the ground up to solve critical concurrency issues in embedded systems. This project is now released as an open-source reference for kernel architecture.
* **Zero-Dependency:** Written in strict ANSI C without LibC dependencies, featuring a custom Standard Library implementation.
* **Advanced Concurrency:** Implements Priority Inheritance to prevent inversion and built-in Deadlock Detection algorithms.
* **Dual-Strategy Memory:** Hybrid O(log n) heap and O(1) fixed-block allocators to ensure determinism.
* **Simulation:** Features a custom Win32 Simulator layer allowing kernel logic to be debugged as a standard console application.


### Current Focus

I am currently architecting a next-generation tooling platform. I am leveraging my background in **GPU computing** and **C++** to bridge the gap between high-performance native code and modern, productive user interfaces.

*(More open-source contributions of similar caliber to SiriusRTOS are in the pipeline.)*
